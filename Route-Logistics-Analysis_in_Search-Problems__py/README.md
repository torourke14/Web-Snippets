# Introduction  
In this project, I worked with different search algorithms in a simulated graphical environment that had a delivery boy delivering pizzas from a restaurant to customers on a grid. Starting his route from his base, he had to do this in an optimal by utilizing Depth First, Breadth First, Limited Depth First Search, and A* Heuristic Search algorithms to complete his task as fast as possible. The problem is, however, he works in many different cities, that all have different characteristics to their layout. I first implemented a Manhattan Distance heuristic, pertinent actions, results from those actions, and cost functions. After this, our aim in this evaluation was to propose different situations where some of these algorithms may work better than others. After analyzing maps such as checkerboards, mazes and basic routes, we discovered how some algorithms are best suited for other cases.
